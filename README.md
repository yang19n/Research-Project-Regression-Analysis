# Research Project 
## Data analysis of turbulence and heat transfer
This analysis is part of my research project.
### Background
The efficiency of many engineering systems could be improved by enhancing heat transfer. Among others, employing turbulence generators is a simple and effective approach to boosting forced convection. The current study aims at revealing the key underlying mechanisms involved in promoting heat convection.
### Tools
Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)
### Related machine learning model
Multiple linear regression
### Dataset
First-hand data collected using hotwire anemometer and thermal camera
